            <h2>Historical Background</h2>
            <p>On August 14th, 1947, the Indian subcontinent was divided into two sovereign states: India and Pakistan. The
                movement for Pakistan, led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, was driven by the demand for a separate nation where
                Muslims could practice their religion freely. The Lahore Resolution of 1940 laid the foundation for this
                demand, eventually leading to the creation of Pakistan.</p>

                <h1>The 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War</h1>
                <p>In 1971, Pakistan faced one of the most significant and tragic events in its history with the secession of East Pakistan, leading to the creation of Bangladesh. The conflict arose due to long-standing political, economic, and cultural disparities between the eastern and western wings of Pakistan. Tensions escalated when the Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, won a landslide victory in the 1970 elections but was denied power. The situation deteriorated into a brutal civil war, culminating in India's intervention and the subsequent surrender of Pakistani forces on December 16, 1971. This event marked a profound moment in Pakistan's history, resulting in the loss of its eastern wing and reshaping the nation's political landscape.</p>

                <h1>The 1998 Nuclear Tests</h1>
                <p>On May 28, 1998, Pakistan conducted its first successful nuclear tests in response to India's nuclear tests earlier that month. These tests, conducted in the Chagai district of Balochistan, made Pakistan the seventh country in the world and the first in the Muslim world to possess nuclear weapons. The decision to go nuclear was driven by the need to ensure national security and maintain a strategic balance in South Asia. The tests were met with international sanctions but were widely celebrated within Pakistan as a demonstration of the country's scientific and military capabilities. The event, known as "Youm-e-Takbeer," is commemorated annually and remains a significant milestone in Pakistan's defense history.</p>

                <h1>The War on Terror and its Impact</h1>
                <p>Following the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, Pakistan became a frontline state in the global War on Terror. Under immense international pressure, Pakistan aligned with the U.S.-led coalition to combat terrorism, leading to significant military operations against extremist groups within its borders, particularly in the tribal areas and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The war brought about profound changes in Pakistan's domestic and foreign policies, as well as severe social and economic impacts. The conflict led to widespread violence, internal displacement, and a surge in terrorist attacks across the country, profoundly affecting the nation's security environment and contributing to ongoing political and social challenges.</p>
